# Flight Ticket Price Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the project **"Flight Ticket Price Prediction"**, completed as an assignment for the course **Machine Learning Practice** in the IIT Madras (Diploma in Data Science).

The project aims to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict flight ticket prices based on various features such as airline, source, destination, duration, and more.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to predict the price of flight tickets using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of flight details such as airline, source, destination, departure and arrival times, duration, number of stops, and additional information.

Key steps include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle and can be found in the associated Kaggle notebook:
- [Kaggle Notebook: ka1-23f2001566](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gokulsivasubramaniam/ka1-23f2001566)

## Results

- Multiple regression models were trained and evaluated.
- The best-performing model achieved competitive accuracy on the test set.
- Feature importance analysis was performed to interpret model predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
